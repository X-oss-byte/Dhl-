1. Run the Setup Wizard
Section titled 1. Run the Setup Wizard
Run the following command in your terminal to start our handy install wizard:
npm
pnpm
Yarn
Terminal window
# create a new project with npm
npm create astro@latest

You can run create astro anywhere on your machine, so there’s no need to create a new empty directory for your project before you begin. If you don’t have an empty directory yet for your new project, the wizard will help create one for you automatically.
If all goes well, you should see a “Liftoff confirmed. Explore your project!” message followed by some recommended next steps. cd into your new project directory to begin using Astro.
If you skipped the npm install step during the CLI wizard, then be sure to install your dependencies before continuing.
2. Start Astro ✨
Section titled 2. Start Astro ✨
Astro comes with a built-in development server that has everything you need for project development. The astro dev command will start the local development server so that you can see your new website in action for the very first time.
Every starter template comes with a pre-configured script that will run astro dev for you. Use your favorite package manager to run this command and start the Astro development server.
npm
pnpm
Yarn
Terminal window
npm run dev

If all goes well, Astro should now be serving your project on http://localhost:4321/!
Astro will listen for live file changes in your src/ directory, so you will not need to restart the server as you make changes during development.
If you aren’t able to open your project in the browser, go back to the terminal where you ran the dev command and look to see if an error occurred, or if your project is being served at a different URL than the one linked to above.
Starter Templates
Section titled Starter Templates
You can also start a new astro project based on an official example or the main branch of any GitHub repository by passing a --template argument to the create astro command.
npm
pnpm
Yarn
Terminal window
# create a new project with an official example
npm create astro@latest -- --template <example-name>

# create a new project based on a GitHub repository’s main branch
npm create astro@latest -- --template <github-username>/<github-repo>

By default, this command will use the template repository’s main branch. To use a different branch name, pass it as part of the --template argument: <github-username>/<github-repo>#<branch>.
