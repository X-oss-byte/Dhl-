Pages
Pages are files that live in the src/pages/ subdirectory of your Astro project. They are responsible for handling routing, data loading, and overall page layout for every page in your website.
Supported page files
Section titled Supported page files
Astro supports the following file types in the src/pages/ directory:
.astro
.md
.mdx (with the MDX Integration installed)
.html
.js/.ts (as endpoints)
File-based routing
Section titled File-based routing
Astro leverages a routing strategy called file-based routing. Each file in your src/pages/ directory becomes an endpoint on your site based on its file path.
A single file can also generate multiple pages using dynamic routing. This allows you to create pages even if your content lives outside of the special /pages/ directory, such as in a content collection or a CMS.

Link between pages
Section titled Link between pages
Write standard HTML <a> elements in your Astro pages to link to other pages on your site. Use a URL path relative to your root domain as your link, not a relative file path.
For example, to link to https://example.com/authors/sonali/ from any other page on example.com:
src/pages/index.astro
Read more <a href="/authors/sonali/sammyfilly">about Sonali</a>.

Astro Pages
Section titled Astro Pages
Astro pages use the .astro file extension and support the same features as Astro components.
src/pages/index.astro
---
---
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>My Homepage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
  </body>
</html>

To avoid repeating the same HTML elements on every page, you can move common <head> and <body> elements into your own layout components. You can use as many or as few layout components as youâ€™d like.
src/pages/index.astro
---
import MySiteLayout from '../layouts/MySiteLayout.astro';
---
<MySiteLayout>
  <p>My page content, wrapped in a layout!</p>
</MySiteLayout>

Markdown/MDX Pages
Section titled Markdown/MDX Pages
Astro also treats any Markdown (.md) files inside of src/pages/ as pages in your final website. If you have the MDX Integration installed, it also treats MDX (.mdx) files the same way. These are commonly used for text-heavy pages like blog posts and documentation.
Collections of Markdown or MDX page content in src/content/ can be used to generate pages dynamically.
Page layouts are especially useful for Markdown files. Markdown files can use the special layout frontmatter property to specify a layout component that will wrap their Markdown content in a full <html>...</html> page document.
src/pages/page.md
---
layout: '../layouts/MySiteLayout.astro'
title: 'My Markdown page'
---
# Title

This is my page, written in **Markdown.**

HTML Pages
Section titled HTML Pages
Files with the .html file extension can be placed in the src/pages/ and used directly as pages on your site. Note that some key Astro features are not supported in HTML Components.
Custom 404 Error Page
Section titled Custom 404 Error Page
For a custom 404 error page, you can create a 404.astro or 404.md file in /src/pages.
This will build to a 404.html page. Most deploy services will find and use it.
